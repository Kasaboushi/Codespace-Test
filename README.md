Welcome to my Pandas tutorial. This is designed to be used with the attached slideshow, and the codespace contains the problems for the lesson. This course aims to act as a primer to basic Pandas usage. 

Documentation for pandas can be found at https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/, or alternatively some basic documentation can be found under notebooks/10-minutes-to-pandas.ipynb.

test.csv is a sample data set.
